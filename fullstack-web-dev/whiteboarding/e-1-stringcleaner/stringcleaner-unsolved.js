// You just invested in some optical character recognition software, but you saved on
//the budget and the software isn't
// that great.

// You quickly realize that the software inserts some unnecessary numerical characters.

// Your job is to write a function that takes these strings as inputs, and cleans out the numeric characters and
// return a string with special characters and spacing all intact.

// For example:
// stringClean('Thi3s looks65 awesom4e!') == 'This looks awesome!'

// Special characters include: ~#$%^&!@*():;"'.,?

// input number params: n>=0 && n<=arr.length

function stringClean(str) {
    // def stringClean(str) as loop through len(str);
    for i in str(i)
    if i={0, 9};
    set i to ' ';
    return str
}

console.log(stringClean('Thi3s looks65 awesom4e!'));
